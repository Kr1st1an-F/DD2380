## Project Structure

The repo is organized by course labs and topics. Each directory contains self-contained implementations of core AI algorithms, with code, tests, and notes.

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **`Lab1/`** | **Introductory AI lab**: Covers foundational search algorithms like BFS, DFS, and UCS (Uniform Cost Search) on puzzle-solving problems (e.g., 8-puzzle). Includes heuristic design and basic state space exploration. Demonstrates uninformed search efficiency and completeness. |
| **`HMM/`** | **Hidden Markov Models**: Implementations for sequence prediction and probabilistic modeling. Includes Viterbi algorithm for decoding, forward-backward for smoothing, and applications like part-of-speech tagging or simple speech recognition. Focuses on probabilistic reasoning in uncertain environments. |
| **`RL/`** | **Reinforcement Learning**: Agents and environments for value-based learning. Features Q-Learning, SARSA, and policy gradients on grid worlds or simple games. Includes exploration strategies (e.g., ε-greedy) and reward visualization. Shows how agents learn optimal policies through trial and error. |
