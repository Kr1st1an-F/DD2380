# Q-learning
## Input
Your interface with the judge is the player file player.py. For this problem, look for PlayerControllerRL class within player.py. 
After editing player.py, rename it as player_2.py for submission.

A sample scenario is provided in the code skeleton (the settings.yml file). 
You are invited to vary the scenario by modifying the settings.yml to test your RL agent on different scenarios.

## Output
The skeleton handles all the output for you. Avoid using stdin and stdout. (Use stderr for debugging.)
